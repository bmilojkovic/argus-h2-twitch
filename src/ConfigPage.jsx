              We have confirmed that your mod has gone through a successful
              login. You don't need to configure anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
              To check if everything looks good, go to the "Stream Manager" tab
              on twitch and click the live preview button for Argus. It is very
              easy to find - it will have our icon ðŸ‘€. When you click on it, a
              window with a preview will pop up. You <b>do not</b> have to be
              live to perform this check.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that the data refreshes only during runs,
              specifically <b>when you exit a room</b>. So if you want to see
              things change, you will need to start a run and complete at least
              one encounter.

              It looks like you have not logged in to twitch from the mod yet.
              :(

              <b>Install the mod.</b> You must have the Argus mod for Hades II
              installed to continue. We suggest using r2modman as the
              modmanager, as Argus is published through Thunderstore. Once you
              have r2modman installed, just search for Argus inside the Hades II
              category and follow the steps outlined in the mod manager.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Twitch authentication.</b> To perform the login process, simply
              run the game with the mod installed. While the game is starting, a
              browser window will pop up asking you to give Argus permission to
              read your username. After you login everything should start
              working. We use this process to ensure that streamers can not be
              impersonated in our system.
            </p>
            <p>
              After you perform the login operation once successfully we will
              not ask you to do it again.
