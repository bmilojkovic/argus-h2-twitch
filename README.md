# Argus 👀 Twitch Extension

The Argus Twitch extension acts as an optional video component that shows viewers the current build in a `Hades II` run.

## Installation instructions

To start using the Argus Twitch extension just go to `Twitch → Creator Dashboard → Extensions → Discovery` and search for Argus. Once you have installed the extension, the configuration panel there will help you with the rest of the setup.

Most notably, you will need `Hades II` installed and the Argus mod. To install and configure the mod, follow the instructions on our [main repository](https://github.com/bmilojkovic/argus-h2-mod).

You can test the extension before going live by opening your `Stream Manager` on Twitch and clicking on the Argus 👀 icon in your `Quick Actions`. A window will pop up showing what your viewers will see when you go live.

## How Argus Works

If you wish to dive deeper into how Argus works, you might want to look at two other relevant repositories:

- [Argus Mod](https://github.com/bmilojkovic/argus-h2-mod)
- [Argus Backend](https://github.com/bmilojkovic/argus-h2-backend)

The mod repository has a TECH_README that covers all the tech stuff in depth.
